This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting a migration of won opportunities from Salesforce to sales orders in SAP.
			
Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.
			
As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
The integration is triggered by the HTTP endpoint to fetch all Salesforce won opportunities suitable for migration.
In the batch the sales order is fetched from SAP by its purchase order number equal to opportunity ID.
If it exists, more sales order details are fetched from SAP.
In next batch step customer is looked up by opportunity account name if sync policy is set to synchronize accounts.
If the customer is found its sales areas are fetched from SAP and first one is selected to be used in sales order creation.
If it is not found, then new customer is created with preconfigured sales area.
Template doesn't support changing customer of the existing sales order.
Next batch step is executed only if preconfigured (dummy) account is configured to be used. In that step also preconfigured sales area and customer number are set up.
Account synchronization policy must be either `syncAccount` or `assignDummyAccount`. Sales order creation will fail if it has no account (ship to) assigned.
Next two steps creates or updates sales order in SAP. 
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will send an email and log output statistics data into the console.
